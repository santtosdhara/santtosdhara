I'm Dhara and  a passionate software developer and tech nerd, and Star Wars fan
May the Force Be With You ðŸ––

I currently work as a Mid-Level Software Developer at Foton InformÃ¡tica.
With over 5 years of experience in the Technology world, I've had the opportunity to learn and work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.

Today I'm an iOS Developer trying to share new features and useful projects and code here and of course, keep learning!!!!
